# Text-Analysis-Character-Frequency-Profiler
This Java application performs advanced frequency analysis on text files (.txt). It cleans, filters, and sorts character data using multiple algorithmic approaches to compare performance and efficiency.

The application currently uses a specific local file path for I/O operations. To run this project on your local machine, please update the filePath variable in the source code to point to your local .txt file.
